# Pokedex App
A Pokedex application inspired by the Pokemon TV series. This app uses an API database to call pokemon details upon pressing a button. Once a Pokemon is called, the Pokemon image, Name, Height, types and abilities are displayed within a modal. The app also contains a navigation bar that provides the option to sort pokemon based on ability and type. Users are able to return specific pokemon through a searchbar.

## How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap

This project focused on developing JavaScript skills and integrating an API to display data in a dynamic and visually appealing way. 

## Optimizations
A limited amount of pokemon images are not pulling in correctly. I need to determine if the images are within the database and prune those that do not display.

## Lessons Learned:
Fetching data from an API
Using JavaScript to create DOM elements
Using JavaScript to implement various methods and manipulate data (e.g. sort/filter, search) 
Using Boostrap to optimize UI
Implementing CSS
Impoving UX
Using text animations to spark interest and keep users engaged
